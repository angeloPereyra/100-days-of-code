# 100 Days Of Code - Log

> Tatagal ba ako ng one week? HAHAHA idk

## Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

## Day 1: June 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Changed schema, database migration, and initial values for our inventory.

**Thoughts:** I really __REALLY__ hope na last time na namin palitan 'tong schema or if not close to reality siya HAHAHA gash. Ilang beses ng napapalitan ung maintenance. Dagdag cols dito, bawas doon. *It's such a __work in progress__*. :sweat:
